<p>
    This application, the "AI Language Generator/Decipherer," is designed to convert textual input into a custom rule-based audio "language" 
    and decipher this audio language representation back into text.
</p>
<p>
    The "AI" in "AI Language Generator/Decipherer" refers to a deterministic, rule-based system, not machine learning or natural language processing.
    It serves as a pedagogical tool for learning full-stack web development with ASP.NET Core Razor Pages, data encoding/decoding, 
    client-side audio manipulation with the Web Audio API, and cloud deployment practices on Azure.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Core Functionalities:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Generator:</strong> Takes text input and converts it into a sequence of sound parameters (frequency, duration, waveform) based on a predefined character-to-sound mapping. These parameters are then used to synthesize audio in the browser.</li>
        <li><strong>Decipherer:</strong> Takes a "sound code" (typically a JSON string representing sound parameters) and converts it back into the original text by reversing the mapping process.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    This project demonstrates key web development concepts including:
    <ul>
        <li>ASP.NET Core Razor Pages for server-side logic and UI rendering.</li>
        <li>C# for backend development.</li>
        <li>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.</li>
        <li>Web Audio API for client-side sound synthesis.</li>
        <li>Basic form handling and data validation.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
