<p>
    This application, the "AI Language Generator/Decipherer," is designed to convert textual input into a custom rule-based audio "language" 
    and decipher this audio language representation back into text.
</p>
<p>
    Navigate to the <strong>Generator</strong> page to create audio from text, or to the <strong>Decipherer</strong> page to convert sound code back into text.
    Learn more about the project on the <strong>About</strong> page.
</p>
<p>
    The "AI" in "AI Language Generator/Decipherer" refers to a deterministic, rule-based system, not machine learning or natural language processing.
    It serves as a pedagogical tool for learning full-stack web development with ASP.NET Core Razor Pages, data encoding/decoding, 
    client-side audio manipulation with the Web Audio API, and cloud deployment practices on Azure.
